# It is common for images of a countryâ€™s previous leaders, or other individuals of historical significance, to appear on its money. # The individuals that appear on banknotes in the United States are listed in below.
# Individual            Amount
# George Washington       $1
# Thomas Jefferson        $2
# Abraham Lincoln         $5
# Alexander Hamilton      $10
# Andrew Jackson          $20
# Ulysses S. Grant        $50
# Benjamin Franklin       $100
# Write a program that begins by reading the denomination of a banknote from the user. 
# Then your program should display the name of the individual that appears on the banknote of the entered amount. 
# An appropriate error message should be displayed if no such note exists.

# Prompts for input from user
denomination = int(input("Enter the denomination of a banknote: $"))

# Determines the individual that appears on the banknote
