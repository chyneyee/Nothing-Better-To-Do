They went on doing business, arranged for journeys, and formed views. How should they have given a thought to anything like plague, which rules out any future, cancels journeys, silicones the exchange of views.

I can’t believe there is such family exists in the world. The mother just asking money from her continuously and doesn’t bother about her daughter’s involvement in prostitution. What she only cares is the money and she asking more and more from her daughter. When one of the daughters decided to further her studies, she disagreed with the idea because she hopes to get more money if both daughters working at the same time and she doesn’t like the delay. It seems she doesn’t feel anything wrong with the daughter selling her body to earn for the income and worse is, she never appreciate all the things that her daughter has done for her and she still loves her worthless son the most. I doubt she will ever feel guilty or regret in the future.<br/><br/>Although Lon never got the chance to have a proper education but she always believe that education can change a person’s life. She tried very hard to save up her money to support her sisters’ education. Comparing to my country where I often heard of kids being scolded by their parents of not putting enough effort in their studies and lots of school dropouts in these recent years, you can just imagine how huge is the difference of these two neighbouring countries.<br/><br/>When Lon started to have problems with her mental health, I wasn’t surprised with it.

Although Ishigami is fond of Yasuko but I felt it’s not a strong reason to convince the readers for the cover-up. The entire story is more to analyzing Ishigami’s plot and how to reveal each of it. What I liked the most in this story is the plot twist towards the end of the story which I guess not many readers can predict about the twist. The author successfully portrays how a mathematician chooses his solution to solve a problem – a solution that is accurate and absolute free from any troubles for Yasuko.,,,1,,,0,,,,,

And I was surprised that this is the author's debut novel because the storytelling and the writing are so compelling and convincing. <br/><br/>The current ending was quite random and irrelevant to me. I mean I can't see the point of having it, but of course, that is just me. Maybe there is a purpose of telling the readers what is next for Zuleikha. Other than that (more like personal opinion), I felt the entire story is very enthralling. It also involves various angles in viewing Zuleikha's marriage. She has different view about their marriage than her husband, Iskander. And the consequences of her action also triggers different opinions from an imam (religious point of view), a prosecutor (legal perspective) and a domestic violence advocate (moral standpoint). I love and respect Zuleikha's decision and I think I will do the same too if I were her. Her decision also sums up that whatever advice was given to her by any outsiders, she is the only one that knows what is best for her and her son.

I was preparing for long-winded descriptions with extensive use of difficult vocabulary words, but surprisingly, this is not the case. I never expect Malcolm Turnbull has a great storytelling skill.

The introduction was always very long-winded.<br/><br/>The way he tells his childhood memories is very mesmerising and intriguing.

I don't know whether my personal opinions will be clouded by what I've read, but I still like to express my views here. It's undeniable that Malcolm Turnbull is a smart and knowledgeable person. I don't have any remarks about his leadership because his life as a prime minister is too short to be assessed. I think he is a visionary person who has a very sharp judgment in almost everything except human nature. It's not about his assessment of others' characters, but it's more about what others behind him are planning to do to him. I felt the question of doubt is not about his leadership but is his characteristics or personality, which I felt unsuitable to be in politics.<br/><br/>Finally, I can summarise what I feel about this book after I finished reading it.

Every man is a problem to the woman no matter she is a victim of the affair or an adulteress. If the woman is an adulteress, she feels distressed because the married man falls in love with her or getting desperate for her.

I have to give credit to the author for his brilliance in writing the Cantonese pronunciations into words. The accuracy of the Cantonese pronunciation and the English translation are superbly close. I enjoyed the story about the Cantonese class. The class won't get bored with Ridge's and Staynes's humour with the Cantonese, but I felt terrible for the teacher.<br/><br/>I felt Chris has excellent storytelling skill, and there is always a positive side in every tense moment. For example, the experience of facing the Chinese military in the town of Sha Tau Kok has been told in a lighthearted manner. The feud between the two villages is hilarious and exciting as well.<br/><br/><b>Book Review:</b> <a href=""https://chyneyee.com/2021/02/26/hong-kong-policeman-by-chris-emmett/"">Hong Kong Policeman by Chris Emmett</a>.",,"Online library loan from Hornsby Library, Sydney.",1,,,0,,,,,

It is a thriller story which I feel slightly uncommon compared to other thriller stories that usually have a strong attachment to the main point and repetitive from the beginning until the ending of the story.<br/><br/>The author’s boundless imagination has created a different feeling for readers when reading the story. With a single focus in this story, which is the savage island, the author is able to express his creativity in linking the characters from different locations in the world and lead the story back to the main plot. Besides that, every character has its own uniqueness of story development.<br/><br/>Although the storyline is interesting and slightly different from other thriller stories which I used to read but it will not be one of my favourite books. The reason is I tend to easily get confused and need some time to follow the storyline. The story involves of too many characters and often jumps from one story to a different story. Even though the author is able to link all the characters to the key point: savage island, but it requires certain effort and limitless imaginations from the author to proceed further for the story development. The effort is obvious as more sub-stories are inserted to carry on the plot. The additional sub-stories which use to create the interconnections of different characters to the savage island increases more confusion on me to understand the story and to distinguish the different characters’ stories.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

However, due to the poor conditions in the prison, stressful guards with their high-risk but low-pay job plus grouping together hundreds of crime offenders in a limited perimeter, the initial purpose to educate a crime offender to be responsible for their committed crime has turned into a survival school. <br/><br/>If they have the chance to be released from the prison, it takes time for them to adapt to the outside world and probably they are still sticking with the survival knowledge which they gained in the prison. The saddest thing is the society treating them differently due to their criminal history which one of the most common reasons that lead them to be repeat offenders. I feel no one have the right to judge or giving them an unfair treatment due to their past if they have a sincere repentance. As none of us is perfect and everyone makes mistakes, maybe the difference is our mistakes are not related to crimes but crime offenders have to bear the responsibility for their committed crimes and pay with their freedom as well.<br/><br/><b>Book Review:</b> <a href=""https://chyneyee.com/2017/03/09/forget-you-had-a-daughter-sandra-gregory/"">Forget You Had A Daughter by Sandra Gregory</a>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It was extremely frustrated when others sincerely expressed their concerns and caring but she sees them as doubting her capabilities and as usual, she feels the reason is she's a woman.

Maybe I'm just being nitpicking or preferring more convincing stories to support the issue.<br/><br/>Initially, I don't understand some of the readers' frustrations because I genuinely feel it was a good story. However, as I continued reading it, I started to feel something doesn't seem right. I thought maybe the readers were just feeling angry with the racial issues, but slowly I guess I can understand where the frustration comes from. Besides feeling unconvincing with some of the dramatic scenes, I think I share the same feelings with some of the readers. It's like if you are a non-African American, it's better that you don't touch the racial issue because you really don't know how they feel. You are not them, and you weren't growing up in their environment. You can't think like them, and you can't be like them. You can write stories about white supremacists or maybe racism towards white people (racism can happen to anyone) but not about something out of your life experience.<br/><br/>I understand she has a good intention to convey the message of racism. However, trying too hard with a lot of cook up stories will cause backfire. Unless you have a strong family background or life experience in that particular area, I guess it's better not to try to venture into any unfamiliar topics for whatever reasons. It's like an American Indian trying to write poverty problems in India or a Japanese writing a story of a Chinese during the Sino-Japanese war.

To be honest, I was surprised by the author's frankness about Malay's weakness in English. Although it is a fictional story, pointing out any flaws in them is a taboo in Malaysia. It didn't go well when it was pointed out by their former Prime Minister himself. I just worry that some readers will get offended with it. However, I admire his courage to express his personal opinion of his own race in the book.<br/><br/>Another surprising thing for me is the number of sexual fantasy and objectification expressed in this book. For me, it was unusual to read it from a Malaysian author. Although I'm not a feminist, activist or whatsoever, I have another concern that some readers will be offended with it, especially in this kind of world that we are living in. Another minor thing to highlight is I had lost count with the number of cigarettes *cough cough* which I've ""smoked"" throughout this book.

Unfortunately, I really don't like the story of the main character's personal life. It's too much for me, and it's taking more than sixty-per cent of the story which involves him flirting with the pathologist. The remaining is about the case investigation.

The more I read (without taking a break), the more I get confused. The content was very mixed up and jumpy. The author threw a few legislations and references of research papers here and there, and suddenly she wants to clarify her reasons for excluding the rape of other genders in this book. Then, she gives the definition of rape and narrows down to the 'false promise to marry'. If the author leaves that part as it is, it will be a good read, but it frustrates me when she includes her own opinion for the definition of rape. Same as underage sex, the author offers her view without a solid point to convince the readers. It will be better if she offers an opinion with a strong argument or provides lesser personal opinions to avoid being viewed as lacking neutrality and subjective in this topic.<br/><br/>Also, there were so many loopholes or unsupported backups for the story provided by the subjects. And the author includes a lot of her opinions to guide readers to think the same way as her. One of the subjects such as Partho, if he is an unreliable source and has a lot of lies, why he is still part of the contributor for this book? Whatever he says are no longer trustable nor can be used in the research, but the author wraps up the story with her personal judgement or what she believes is the truth. I mean she mentioned that Partho made up a lot of extravagant stories and she doesn't trust him, then she should find other more reliable sources instead of wasting her time interviewing him, telling us something that is not true, and wasting her time and effort to dissect his lies and humiliating him with sarcasm in the book.<br/><br/>I really hope there will be other people out there will love this book and know how to appreciate her work.

Nancy's friends try to help to ease the tension, and Nancy's attention is being highlighted throughout the story.

How can she differentiate the pigeon which was injured earlier with other pigeons?<br/><br/>I felt disappointed because of Nancy back to being pushy again. And Nancy seems to show more authorities on everyone around her. I felt sorry for Effie for Nancy's inconsiderate behaviour. I wondered whether I will snap on Nancy if I were Effie.

She described the details of all 18 guests' outfits except a couple who is not part of the residents in the town.<br/><br/>The main character is very self-centred, controlling, judgemental, impulsive, unreasonable, inconsiderate, ignorant, and annoying. Why she keeps pushing people to tell her everything? Nobody can keep anything for themselves, and nobody can forget anything. In another part of the story, she suggests to plan for her friend's wedding, but the conversation turns to the murder case. When her friend asks whether they can discuss the wedding plan instead of the murder, she says no because she won't let it go until it clears up. What??? Also, she loves herself a lot and feels that she is perfect. She keeps mentioning some people who don't like her, and she feels weird, and she doesn't understand why people don't like her.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if I want to try the third book.

However, the first chapter of this book already won my interest to continue reading it. This book is straight to the point, telling the readers just to accept shit happens and stop chasing for perfection. This is so different from other books which continuously asking you to keep telling yourself that you can do it, keep trying, take someone's achievements as a goal and lots of bullshit and crap. How does it motivate you when it makes you more depressing?<br/><br/>The best lesson from the first chapter is to prioritise what f*cks to give. Give a f*ck about something more important than adversity. That is so true. I have to admit that sometimes I do get upset about certain unimportant things, but when I calm myself down and have a more profound thought about it, I will ask myself. Why do I want to give a f*ck about it? It's just a trivial matter, and some people are just passersby in my life. It's just our lives cross paths due to unexpected occasions or events and why I need to bother about what a passer-by said or done? It's not simple, and I'm still learning it, but it's a piece of valuable advice: Prioritise. Reserve the f*cks for what truly matters. Like what the author mentioned in the book, that's probably the only thing I want to keep trying instead of continuously giving f*cks to anything.<br/><br/>Book Review: <a href=""https://chyneyee.com/2019/04/01/the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck-a-counterintuitive-approach-to-living-a-good-life-mark-manson/"">The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life by Mark Manson</a>.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I don’t see there is any interesting parts in each story that can capture readers’ interest in it. Also, it seems the men were all bad and the women were all victims or experiencing difficult life. Most of the stories were quite depressing.<br/><br/>I struggled my way to finish this book and tried to finish it as soon as possible so I can read a better book after this. My conclusion about this book: simple English but complicated plots, random stories, weird characters, depressing, difficult to understand and no clear theme in each story.<br/><br/>https://chyneyee.com/2013/08/30/the-secrets-of-a-fire-king-kim-edwards/",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The main characters are Abdullah and his sister Pari but the story not only involves their separation but also other characters who involves in their life. It's a story with several sub-stories of other characters telling what happens to them at the same time when they are experiencing this miserable separation.<br/><br/>If I am being asked whether I like this book, my answer will be average. Although the narration style to separate the different characters' stories might seem easier to understand but I will prefer the author's previous writing style. I had read the previous two books long time ago. If I'm not mistaken, the previous two books did not have too much of detailed descriptions or flowery words. Maybe it's because I've read other different genre novels before this and reading this book with too many flowery sentences is really quite difficult for me to understand the story. To be honest, I have to read a couple of times for some paragraphs to understand the story. Well, I admit that my English is not that good to capture the meaning of those flowery words and I guess I really have to work it out more to improve myself. I'm not saying the author's writing is bad, in fact, I feel he's a talented writer and a good storyteller but the writing style in this book doesn't suit me. In brief, I like the previous two novels more compared to this one.

Despite of that feeling, I never expect that it was more than that after reading the story. I do believe that uncommon experiences is one of the reasons that leads him to become a well-known bestselling author. The entire biography wasn't that bad as what others had reviewed here. I checked some of those reviews before I started to read the book and I have doubts whether I should proceed to read it.<br/><br/>However, when it comes to the middle part of the biography, I started to believe some of the negative reviews about this book. I felt bored and wished to skip the story which relates to black magic. It was written in a dull and confused way but I was able to finished the book without skipping any of the chapters. Despite my dislike about the story of black magic in the book, I feel the entire biography is interesting and I enjoyed reading it. Maybe I just like the beginning and the ending of the book especially the letter to the author of this biography. Although Paulo experienced many different lives and probably some of the things that he did in the past may be unethical or immoral for me, this doesn't stop me to continue reading his novels. Everyone has a past. It doesn't bother me at all. His novels should not be judged by his past.<br/><br/>I feel the biography can inspire us to become someone that will never give up in chasing our dreams despite the difficulties that we will face during the process. Although his success was not fully recognised in his own country but his novels usually appear in the bestselling list around the world. It's heartache when being likened almost everywhere in the world except your own country and the reason is always something indescribable.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Initially, I planned to rate this book 3/5 but after a second thought, I had changed my mind when I found a valuable lesson from this book. A good looking person does not indicate that person will have more likeable character, smarter or least possibility of committing crimes. A bad tempered person or someone with a complicated background should not be labelled as the prime suspect when crimes occur.

However, if you get confused with the relationships when you are reading it, you can always go back to the first page to check the diagram of the family tree for a better understanding. That is something very thoughtful from the author as the family tree diagram is really useful for the readers as a reference to understand the story.

I thought I will get the ending but there were some questions remained unanswered and I have to read backward to get some answers to those questions. In the end, I just have to let go when I tell myself “Life is too short to read a book which is not meant for you. That’s what people always said about relationships. It applies to books as well.” To be honest, I feel so much relieved after I let it go. The moral of the story is if you feel something doesn’t right at the first place, just learn to let it go and you will thank yourself of the attempt and you start to think how stupid of your stubbornness.<br/><br/>The detailed review: https://chyneyee.com/2017/11/18/the-wangs-vs-the-world/.",,"Library Loan from Hornsby Library, Sydney",1,,,0,,,,,
