 * (Algebra: solve 2 x 2 linear equations) You can use Cramerâ€™s rule to solve the following
 * 2 * 2 system of linear equation:
 * 	ax + by = e   x = 	ed - bf	  y = af - ec
 * 	cx + dy = f       	ad - bc       ad - bc
 * Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y:
 * 		3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5
 * 		2.1x + .55y = 5.9
