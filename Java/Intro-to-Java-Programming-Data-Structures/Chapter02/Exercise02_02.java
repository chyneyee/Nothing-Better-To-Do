 * (Compute the volume of a triangle) Write a program that reads in the length of sides of an equilateral triangle
 * and computes the area and volume using the following formulas:
 * 			area = (âˆš 3 /4)* length of sides * length of sides
 * 			volume = area x length
 * 
 * Here is a sample run:
 * Enter length of the sides and height of the equilateral triangle: 3.5
 * The area is 3.89
 * The volume of the Triangular prism is 19.48
